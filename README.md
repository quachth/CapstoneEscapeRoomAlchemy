# CapstoneEscapeRoom
Capstone class group repo for escape room

Escape rooms are thrilling and challenging puzzle games and are popular all over the world. In the games, players are immersed in a virtual setting, taking on the roles of characters who must explore their surroundings in first-person mode. They solve tasks and puzzles by using objects or tools within the rooms. 

In our project, we aim to design and develop a 3D escape room challenge by using the Unity game engine. We plan to create 3 different themed rooms, and each room will be packed with 3 or more puzzles to enhance the overall challenge and enjoyment. Players are required to unravel puzzles, find clues, and ultimately escape the rooms. We will implement HUD UI features such as countdown timers, helpful prompts, and a hint system to ensure players are fully engaged in each room. Our goal is to provide players with an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience. 

The user will enter the game in the first room where they will be introduced to the “story”/premise. The player character is given the background of a dimensional-traveler, not unlike Doctor Who, who is stumbling through multiple worlds in their attempt to get home. They will be given instructions for how to navigate through the game and access hints as they go along. The user will initiate the timer and begin the game.

Each room will be inspired by a different pop-culture reference and the details of the room itself along with each of the clues will be related to that theme. The user will follow prompts on their screen and will move forward through the rooms as they solve the puzzles. Each of the puzzles will range in difficulty and type (logic, physics, matching, etc.). If a user finishes the game before the time runs out, they will win the game. Otherwise, they will lose and have an option to play again.
